Description: 
        easysvm is a front end to the shogun toolbox. It aims to be a
        'quick start' tutorial for users interested in shogun. As such,
        it covers only the absolute basics of machine learning.
        More advanced users should directly use the interfaces provided
        by shogun.
        
        This setup.py installs two modules:
        - esvm (which contains some basic tools for machine learning with SVMs)
        - splicesites (which contains tools for splice site prediction)
        
        It also installs two scripts (easysvm.py and datagen.py) in the relevant binary directory.
        The two scripts provide a command line interface to the toolkit.
